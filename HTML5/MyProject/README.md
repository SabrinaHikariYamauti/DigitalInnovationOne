# HTML5
The HTML5 is a HyperText Markup Language which means that it is used to build a Web and it can be interpreted by navigators.

In this project, I created fake FACENS website. The full name is Faculdade de Engenharia de Sorocaba and  I study Mecatronic Engineering there.

At the first time, I created the website using only HTML5 and CSS. Then, after building the Netflix Interface, I updated the project by adding carousel feature. 

Get to know the University:
